# TODO

This is just a living document on things that could/will get implemented.

If you are looking for things to try implementing, this is a good place to look.

- Give players N time to reconnect before losing slots

## Stats

- Make sure spec is no
- Make win rate only count when player was in game for > N minutes & > N players
- Trigger match start / end from source mod instead of the current guesswork
    - Attach the demo to the match_id, probably using a match uuid returned from match start call.
